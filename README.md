# Power-Flow-Analysis-Tool
A Python-based command-line tool for performing power system load flow analysis using the Gauss-Seidel and Newton-Raphson methods. It calculates bus voltages, power losses, and current flows for small power systems. Includes input/output functionality and test cases for validation.

# Load Flow Analysis Tool

## Overview
This Python tool performs load flow analysis for small power systems using the **Newton-Raphson method**. It calculates essential parameters such as bus voltages, power losses, and current flows, providing a valuable resource for power system analysis and management.

## Team Members
- **SWATI**: Implements the mathematical models for the Newton-Raphson method.
- **SATVIKA**: Creates input/output functions for buses and lines.
- **LAKSHMI**: Writes usage instructions and validates results with sample inputs.

## Features
- **Bus Voltage Calculation**: Determines voltage levels at various buses in the power system.
- **Power Loss Calculation**: Assesses power losses in transmission lines.
- **Current Flow Evaluation**: Computes current flowing through the lines.

## Usage
1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
2. **Running the Tool**: Execute the main script from the command line.
3. **Input Format**: Provide data related to buses and transmission lines as specified in the documentation.
4. **Output**: The tool displays calculated bus voltages, power losses, and current flows.

## Documentation
